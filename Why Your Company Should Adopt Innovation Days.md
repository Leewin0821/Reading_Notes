An Innovation Day is typically a 24-hour event in which employees form small teams to try and solve a problem relevant to the business. The teams have to present their ideas back to the business with a strong business case and working prototype. Many companies have their version of an Innovation Day. 

何谓创新日？这是一项持续24小时的活动，来自不同的小团队的员工们尝试并解决工作相关难题。参赛队伍需要通过翔实的商业案例和可行的原型来展示他们的创意。许多的公司都有各自的创新日。

What can a company gain from an Innovation Day? How can you successfully take an idea, put it into production, and ensure it resonates with your customers?

公司能从创新日中收获什么？你怎样才能成功孵化一个点子，使之产品化，并保证它能和你的顾客产生共鸣呢？

###Never underestimate your staff

###永远不要低估你的员工

Traditionally new ideas for products or digital direction are filtered from the top down within an organisation, unless you’re Google or run a flat management system.

在传统的组织里，产品和数字化方向的创新都是从上到下层层审批的，除非你的公司叫Google或者你处在一个扁平化管理的公司。

This traditional style of idea generation can sometimes stop the best ideas from coming to fruition. It’s the companies who are willing to take the leap and try something new that become the success stories of tomorrow.

这种传统的孵化模式有时会阻碍最好的创意面世，而只有敢于尝试并且实践新东西的公司才能引领时代。

Sometimes the best ideas are generated from those who work ‘in’ and not ‘on’ the business. These people see problems that customers and colleagues have on a daily basis that could be fixed from a simple bit of technology. Or identify a gap in the market based on something they would find useful as a consumer.

有时候最好的创意来自于与业务间接相关的员工，而不是直接相关的人。这些人能发现用户和其他同事在日常使用中遇到的，能用简单技术就可以解决的问题，或是基于自身的经验指出产品功能与市场需求之间的间隙。

Decision makers at the top can sometimes be paralysed by running the business, whereas staff are more open to think freely, as they don’t tend to think about the constraints of an idea. Mars Celebrations, for instance, was the brainchild of an ordinary Mars worker in the UK, and has since earned millions for the brand.

顶层的决策者为了公司事务往往耗尽心力，但是一般员工却能脑洞大开，因为他们不会太在意一个点子的各种限制。举个例子，为英国Mars食品公司带来丰厚回报的Mars Celebrations，原本只是一名普通工人的点子。

###Seemingly old-fashioned brands are embracing innovation

###老品牌正在拥抱创新变化

Banks are stereotypically seen as having an iron-fronted, non-innovative approach to business, and although many claim they put their customers first, many fail to practice what they preach. While this might be the stereotypical response, one of Australia’s banks have embraced user-centred design and team Innovation Days. They ditched the cumbersome waterfall approach in favour of a continuous-delivery methodology when it comes to their digital products.

在固有的观念里，银行业是一个和创新毫不相干的行业。银行员工口口声声地说“以用户为重”，然而却常常做不到他们的承诺。“以用户为重”，即使这是一个典型的口号，仍然有一家澳大利亚的银行选择了拥抱用户中心设计和团队创新日。在开发线上产品时，他们摒弃了笨重的瀑布流，换成了持续交付的方式。

###An idea is born

###当有了一个点子

An Innovation Day at a well-known bank, for example, inspired an idea to solve the issue of friends sharing the cost of bills. It would become a feature within the existing banking app and allow users to share group bills and send texts to their friends—telling how much they owe, their bank details, and providing them with a unique reference number that could later be used to track when a friend has paid them.

让我们来举个例子：在一所著名的银行，某个创新日催生出了如何解决朋友之间分摊账单的方法。这很可能会成为现有银行应用的一个功能，允许用户共享账单，然后发送短信给用户的朋友，提示他们应该支付多少钱，目前他们的账户余额怎样，并且还能给用户提供一个唯一的编号，让用户能跟踪账单的偿还状况。

The feature would target a younger audience who, from the research, share bills on a frequent basis. The new concept was seen as something that no other bank was offering and would allow the brand to target a new audience.

根据研究，这项功能瞄准的是年轻一代的用户，他们有着很频繁的分摊账单的需求。这个想法发觉了某些别的银行没能提供的东西，并且能让公司锁定一批新的用户群体。

###Can’t justify 24 hours?

###抽不出24小时空来？

If you can’t justify taking 24 hours out of the ‘usual’ working period to run a Innovation Day, you could try an ‘innovation sprint’. Staff can post ideas or problems they want to solve up to a week before (the same as an Innovation Day). Individuals can then choose which idea they’d like to solve, and rather than building a working prototype, they could brainstorm the idea and develop a solution. The sprint would be limited to a normal 8-hour day.

如果你没法从“平常”的工作中抽出24小时来运作一次创新日，你可以试试来一次“创新冲刺”。员工们可以提前一周把点子和他们想解决的问题贴在一面墙上（和创新日的做法一样）。然后大家可以选择他们想解决的问题，参与者进行头脑风暴，想出解决方案，而不是做一个可行的原型出来。这种冲刺被限制为一个工作日，即8个小时。
 
Running Innovation Days, sprints, or even weekends, can not only help empower staff and help with team building, but can also create new initiatives for your brand.

组织创新日，创新冲刺甚至创新周末的好处，不仅是能帮助员工提升实力，培养团队，还能为你的公司带来新的活力。

###Taking the idea to production

###实践创意

The concept was successfully pitched at an Investor Day, giving the team a small budget to explore the idea further. Once this phase was complete, it was handed to the mobile app team to build into the existing banking app.

在一个投资者日里，这个分摊账单的方案被成功通过，提出方法的团队获得了一笔小的资助，这使得他们能够继续探索。当他们完成了探索，应用开发团队就立马接手来实现这个功能，将其添加到现有的银行应用里面。

Innovation Days were a new concept within the bank and - like with any new process - it was a case of trial, error, and improvement. The bill sharing concept was the first Innovation idea to go into production.

对这家银行来说，创新日曾是一个新奇的想法，就像其他新的实践一样，这是一个关于试错和提升的实践。账单分摊的想法曾是第一个加入产品的创新点子。

It became apparent early on that the new feature couldn’t simply be added within the existing app’s code base. Due to the short time the team had to work on the idea, there were a lot of areas left unanswered in terms of the user experience, functionality, and technology.

将这个点子转变为新的功能还为时尚早，因为提出方案的团队并没有充足的时间去考虑，所以仍然有许多问题亟待解决，比如用户体验设计，功能性设计和技术细节。

###Get it ‘out’, then get it ‘right’

###先做出，再做对

Launching with an MVP version of your innovation is a great way to ensure it hits the market before your competitors launch something similar. Many brands feel they need to spend time refining until it’s perfect before they launch. Working with an Agile methodology and getting an MVP version out as fast as possible allows you to test your idea with real users, refine, improve, and implement. While you can refine and improve your MVP version, your competitors are having to start from scratch to try and catch up. By the time they have caught up, you will have market share, along with a more advanced product and more in-depth user knowledge.

将创意包装成MVP然后快速上线，是领先竞争对手抢占市场的有效手段之一。很多公司认为他们应该不断地打磨产品，直到完美才能上线。相比之下，采用敏捷的开发方式，尽快推出MVP可以让你的点子尽早接触到真正的用户，接受反馈，不断进步。当你在不断完善你的MVP时，你的竞争对手才刚开始从头做起，追赶你的步伐。当他们终于赶上时，你已经靠着成熟的产品和深刻的用户知识占有相当的市场份额了。

The bank’s bill sharing concept wasn’t initially going to have an MVP version. It was, however, going to receive a large marketing campaign; something the app had never received even when first launched. Although the app is always being refined to improve the user’s experience using the continuous delivery approach, launching a new feature with the backing of a large marketing campaign requires ensuring that the customer is centre of mind to avoid jeopardising user confidence and the brand’s reputation.

上面提到的那家银行的分摊账单方案，在一开始的时候并没有被做成MVP，而是直接参与了一项大型的营销活动，这也是该银行的应用从未尝试过的。虽然该应用一直都通过持续交付方式来不断提高用户体验，但是上线一项承担着大型营销活动任务的新功能，格外需要保证以用户为中心，这样才不会降低用户好感，维护好公司的口碑。

It’s important not to make user-assumptions. This can not only risk wasting time building something users find confusing, but can also waste valuable time designing a user interface that doesn’t resonate with the user.

一定不要事先做用户假设，这会导致你浪费时间做出一些不会引起用户共鸣，反而会让他们觉得困扰的设计出来。

![Making user assumption wastes time. ](https://www.thoughtworks.com/sites/default/files/styles/retina_ready/public/assets/MakingUserAssumptions.gif?itok=pRg1JM_9)
 
To avoid the risk of jeopardising the concept, the team, which consisted of ThoughtWorkers and bank staff, built a case for justifying a soft-launch of the product. This allowed the team time to get user feedback, incorporate learning, and launch with a more user-friendly feature.

为了点子能顺利实现，由ThoughtWorker和银行员工组成的队伍做出了一个样品来软启动整个项目。这让团队有足够时间接收用户评价，消化学习，然后推出更贴合用户的功能。

The product owner fully supported the decision to 'get it out, then get it right' approach. Having the product owner’s support speaks volumes for the great team relationship.

银行的产品负责人完全赞同“先做出，再做对”的方案，有了负责人的支持，整个团队就有了高度的凝聚力。

###Making the idea better for the end user

###将创意打磨得更适合终端用户

Whatever new innovation you’re launching, whether it’s a new type of confectionery like Mars Celebrations or a new banking app feature, getting into the minds of your customers is key to its success. You may have the best technology, but if the design and experience of interacting with your idea does not resonate with your audience, you’ve failed.

无论你准备实现什么新创意，也许它是像Mars Celebrations一样的新型甜点，或者是一个银行应用的新功能，洞悉你的用户的想法才是成功的关键。你可能掌握着最好的技术，但是如果创意的设计和交互体验引不起用户的共鸣，那你就已经失败了。

![](https://www.thoughtworks.com/sites/default/files/styles/retina_ready/public/assets/BestTechintheWorld.png?itok=qsxwiEJJ)

With the bill sharing concept, we selected a group of users that met our target profile and conducted face-to-face user testing, which was invaluable to the project. This allowed us to confirm the following:

我们选择了一些档案匹配核心用户的志愿者，组织了一次面对面的用户测试。这给团队带来了无比宝贵的价值，它帮助我们确认了以下事情：

* The new flow we wanted to implement was the correct approach. Validating this before we started re-coding saved time and money.
* 我们想实现的新流程才是正确的。在我们重新编码之前验证了的这一点，使我们节约了大量的时间和金钱。
* The younger audience does not like to read detail! Finding this out helped us write the correct onboarding messaging and prompts.
* 年轻的用户根本不喜欢长文说明！这一发现帮助我们写出了正确的引导消息和提示。
* 50% of users paid attention to adding the reference number, as requested in the text message. Finding this out helped us avoid wasting any more time refining the messaging and thinking of alternate ways to improve it.
* 有50%的用户会记得填入验证码，就像在短信里要求的那样。这点发现有助于我们避免浪费时间去重新设计短信内容和另寻他法来提升体验。
* Removing what I believed to be unnecessary text to give a cleaner design, was proven to be something users preferred; they still understood the context.
* 用户的选择证明了，就算移除不必要的信息，他们也能理解上下文。而且他们也偏爱简洁的设计。

It’s essential for a brand to engage consumers and take them along for the journey. The younger audience likes to get involved and the users of our app are very vocal; embracing this not only improved our new feature, but also made our younger customers feel valued.

对一个公司来说，组织用户进行一次用户测试非常有必要。年轻用户喜欢参与感，并且我们的用户也直言不讳。进行这样的测试不仅有助于改进我们的新功能，还能让我们的顾客感觉到被重视。

Along with conducting face-to-face user testing for the ‘soft launch’, we also wanted users to give us feedback on the new feature. This would help us improve it in time for the official launch, which would coincide with the marketing campaign.

为了软启动，除了组织面对面的用户测试，我们同时也希望获得用户对新功能的反馈。这将在正式上线之前帮助我们提高，同时还能为营销活动做好准备。

A small message that wouldn’t intrude on the user's experience of the app was added. It simply read: “Hey, we’re building this new feature that we think you might like. It would be great if you can help us out, try it and give us some feedback.”

在应用里，我们加上了一段不会破坏体验的小字：“你好，我们正在开发新功能，而且我们猜你应该会喜欢它的。如果你能试用这段应用，给我们一些反馈，帮助我们开发出来，那就真是太棒啦。”

Unsure if we would gain useful (or any) feedback from our users, we felt it was important to try. Within a day of the ‘soft launch’ we started receiving great feedback. This enabled us to prioritise our ‘wish list’ of improvements allowing us to avoid wasting time implementing the wrong items, and ensured we gave our users what they wanted, rather than what we thought they wanted.

一开始我们并不确定是否能从用户那儿获得反馈，更别说有用的反馈了。然而出乎我们意料的是，在软启动不到一天的时间内，我们就收获了大量的反馈。这简直像是给我们列出了心愿清单，让我们能直接开发出用户需要的，而不是我们以为他们需要的，从而避免了浪费时间做无用功。

![Does your new product know its place within your brand's architecture](https://www.thoughtworks.com/sites/default/files/styles/retina_ready/public/assets/BrandArchitecture.gif?itok=dp2YGBae)

###Design can make all the difference to your new innovation

###设计对创意无比重要

When launching a new product, not only do you need to ensure it resonates with your customer, gives a great user experience, and technically works, but it must also ‘know its place’ within your brand architecture. Ask yourself the following:

当推出一个新产品时，你除了需要保证它能引起用户的共鸣，提供优秀的用户体验和可靠的技术支持之外，还必须清楚知道它在你公司中的地位。试着自问一下：

* If it’s a new feature within an existing product:
* 如果这是已有产品的新功能：
  * Does it still reflect the brand guidelines?
  * 那么它是否仍然遵循品牌的设计原则？
  * Are there ways you can still improve the design, without going away from guidelines, to ensure the customer gets a new experience but still recognises the brand?
  * 在不偏离设计原则的情况下，你是否能找到方法来提升设计，保证用户在“熟悉的感觉”中获得全新的体验？
* If it’s a completely new standalone product, which doesn’t need to rely on the main brand name to support it:
* 如果这是一个单独的全新的产品，而且不需要公司品牌影响力来支撑：
  * Does it resonate with the target market and stand out from other possible competitors?
  * 在竞争市场上它是否足够吸引用户，竞争力远超其他对手？

###How did we achieve it?

###我们怎么做到的？

The bank we were working with targets the older generation, whereas the new feature was very much for the younger generation.

我们为之服务的银行的主要客户是年长一代，然而这个新功能却基本是为年轻人开发的。

The younger generation within the mobile world is very passionate and vocal about being an ‘Apple’ or ‘Android’ follower. Both platforms have very different user interface designs and interaction, yet the majority of native apps, particularly Bank Apps, tend to use an iOS style across both App platforms.

年轻人对移动世界可是相当的热情，大声地宣布自己是“Apple”或“Android”的粉丝。这两个平台在用户界面和交互设计上有着很大的不同，然而大多数的原生应用却倾向于在两个应用平台上都使用iOS的风格，尤其是银行的应用。

We wanted the new feature to give the user a true native app experience, along with still feeling like the same bank. We only had a few weeks to implement and test both UI designs, which required prioritising for the maximum effect. Both iOS and Android style icons were implemented, along with appropriate layouts meeting material design and iOS guidelines. We were also able to integrate some native interaction gesture animations.

我们希望在“熟悉的银行，熟悉的感觉”的基础上，让新功能带给用户真正原生的体验。此时我们只有几周时间来开发和测试所有的UI设计，这就要求我们必须把最重要的部分优先安排起来。在完成iOS和Android风格的的图标绘制，设计好依循Material Design和iOS设计原则的排版之后，我们就能集成一些原生手势的交互动画了。

![Making teams work in a silo is a mistake ](https://www.thoughtworks.com/sites/default/files/styles/retina_ready/public/assets/Silosamistake.gif?itok=PrpiVXee)

###Why different departments should work as one

###为什么不同的部门应该齐心合作

If your new innovation is digital, such as an app, wearable, or piece of software, it’s important that all the teams involved - from creation to production to launch - all work together and are kept informed.

如果你有一个数字创意，比如一个应用，穿戴式设计或是软件的功能，那你最好让从设计到运营的所有团队都参与进来，所有人都在一起工作，能够顺畅交流。

Many companies keep digital, branding, and marketing teams apart, thinking neither understands the other, which causes complications. Marketing teams may be misinformed, or perhaps not understand the unique selling point; the digital teams might not be given the correct brand position for the product, or know correct deadlines.

很多公司都把IT，业务和营销团队分开，认为他们没必要认识彼此，那样只会把问题搞复杂。营销团队可能会被误导，或是没能抓住独特的市场卖点；IT团队也可能会搞错产品的定位，或是开发错过最后期限。

Having all the teams working together avoids ‘middle men’ obstructing the flow of information and leads to a much better outcome.

所有团队在一起工作就能避免出现“中间人”阻塞信息的传播，还能产出好得多的结果。

With the bank's new concept, we kept the marketing team informed with the improved features, latest UI designs, and insights from user testing, which we felt would help with their FAQ webpage. This strengthened their PR efforts. We were also kept up-to-date on the progress of the campaign concepts and media schedule. Having a direct relationship avoided ‘middle men’ passing messages and created one large team working towards one goal, rather than several teams heading in different directions trying to meet the same goal.

在实现上文的账单分摊功能时，我们让营销团队时刻掌握改进的功能，最新的UI设计和用户测试带来的新发现，我们认为这些发现能帮助他们更好的设计FAQ页面。这无疑有助于他们的公关工作。营销团队也会向我们更新营销大赛进展和媒体通告。团队之间直接联系就避免了传话筒的出现，也把不同团队凝聚在一块儿向着同一个目标努力，而不是不同的团队为了达到同一个目标向着不同的方向使劲。

###What can we learn from this?

###我们能从中学到什么？

Listening to staff from all areas of the business can not only generate remarkable innovations to transform your business, but also makes staff feel more valued. If you employ a large number of Gen Ys, holding Innovation Days is a great way to encourage their personal growth.

倾听来自不同职位的员工关于业务的见解，不仅会收获了不起的创意，还能让员工感觉被重视。如果你的员工里有很多年轻人，举办创新日将是一个帮助他们快速成长的好方式。

> “58% of Gen Y want pathways to personal growth and want this closely tied to recognition initiatives.” - Huff, C, 2006

> "58%的年轻人都渴望找到个人发展的道路，而且想将其打上深深的个人烙印。" - Huff, C, 2006

To reduce possible production problems, ensure you get everyone who would be impacted involved from the beginning. This will not only help you better estimate the effort, but the wider team might have further ideas on how best to build the product.

为了减少可能出现的产品问题，确保在项目一开始就让涉及到的所有人都参与进来。这样除了能帮你更好的预估工作量之外，更大的团队也会在怎样最好地开发设计产品上提出更独到的主意。

![Ensure your product resonates with your audience. ](https://www.thoughtworks.com/sites/default/files/styles/retina_ready/public/assets/ProductResonates.gif?itok=7MjRRKB4)
   
Don’t be afraid to refine and test your new product throughout the build cycle; ensure your target audience is always centre of mind. Ensuring your product not only resonates with your audience visually but also functionally (solving a problem) is a sure-fire way to ensure its success. 

不要害怕通过构筑循环来提升和测试你的新产品；保证你始终把核心用户放在首位。确保你的产品不仅看起来能让你的用户产生共鸣，而且使用起来，在解决用户痛点时也一样爽快。这些才是你的产品通往成功的康庄大道。
