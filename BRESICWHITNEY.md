 创新实验室帮助顾客更快找到梦中的家
 
BresicWhitney is an Australian lifestyle property group founded in 2003. The company is now a multi-office brand connecting people and property within Sydney’s widespread inner-city basin.

BresicWhitney是澳洲的顶尖房产中介公司，成立于2003年。目前这家公司拥有多处办公室，负责将顾客和悉尼广袤的内城区域的房产联结起来。

Their ambition is to bring honour back into the real estate industry by building trust with buyers and, at the same time, adding value to property sellers.

他们的愿景是，与买家建立信任，同时为房产卖家增加价值，重塑房地产行业的辉煌。

Together with ThoughtWorks they chose to run a time boxed innovation lab, a process that allows validating ideas quickly with real customers rather than making a big upfront investment.
 
在贸然投入大笔投资之前，他们选择与ThoughtWorks一起进行限时的创新实验室活动，通过真实用户来快速验证想法。

Using real-time observations and interviews, the team quickly uncovered that property seekers needed better ‘price transparency of auctions’ and availability of ‘strata reports’ to simplify the buying decision process. A working prototype was delivered after only three days of development.

经过现场观察和访谈，合作团队很快发现如果想简化房产买家的决策流程，那么就需要更价格透明的拍卖和更靠谱的维护记录。在仅仅三天之后，一个可工作的原型就诞生了。

The HTML5 mobile web app allows property seekers to access their desired reports on any smartphone while inspecting a property, giving buyers as much information as possible to expedite the decision making process. In real time, the agent can see which reports were accessed, when and where. The app creates a prioritised list that helps agents focus on warm property seekers so they can better help them find the right home that meets their needs.

这是一个HTML5的手机网页应用，允许用户可以在现场看房时，通过手机获得任何他们想要的报告，为用户提供充足的信息来加速决策。同时，代理人能够看到哪些报告在何时何地被查看过。换而言之，这个应用创建了一个优先级的列表，协助代理人更好地找到满足顾客的需求的房产。

The new product is already demonstrating results. Property seekers are empowered to make quicker decisions which has a positive impact on BW’s sales cycle (down from several days to 24 hours). This allows BW to bring property seekers, sellers, and agents together in a way that creates a meaningful experience.  

这个新产品已经展示出了成果：房产买家能够更快地做出决策，不仅对BW的销售周期来说有着积极的意义（从几天降低到了24小时），还为房产买卖双方及代理人创造了很有意义的体验。
