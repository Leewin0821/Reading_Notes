 > "BresicWhitney is a Sydney based real estate agency. And we are transitioning towards more of an intergrated property services lifestyle group. We've seen quite dramatic changes in real estate industry. We've got new and emerging players, we've got changes and behaviour from buyers and from sellers. As a result, we've had a lot of change in the role of the tranditional real estate agency. BresicWhitney's ambition is to bring some honour back into the industry, we are looking at building trust again with buyers. As a result, we are looking at how we can add value and contribute to people who trying to sell. We decided to partener with ThoughtWorks, and the decision was to run a time boxed innovation lab."
 
 Shannan Whitney (CEO, BresicWhitney): BresicWhitney是悉尼的一家房地产中介机构，目前我们正在向一家全功能房产生活服务集团公司转型。我们发现房地产这个行业发生着翻天覆地的变化：新的玩家不断浮现，买卖双方的行为持续变化。作为一家传统的房地产中介公司，我们也不得不改变了很多。BresicWhitney的愿景是与买家建立信任，重塑房地产行业的辉煌。为了达到这个目标，我们一直在寻找方法，怎样才能为潜在卖家做出贡献，带来价值。因此，我们决定和ThoughtWorks合作，而合作的产物就是举行一场定时的创新实验室活动。
 
 > "We're here for a three week engagement and we dedicated the first week understand the buyer behaviours. We did that through contextual enquiry, some face to face interviews, open for expectations and some phone interviews. We found buyers have two main pain points: one is price transparency around auctions, and second one is access to property reports. So we built an app in first eight days, and we were able to delivery guys reports and test their response. That's important, so we can refine and move on in the process in that subsequence two weeks. By embedding at BresicWhitney we are able to build measure and learn far more quickly, so we can validate any product ideas before bring them to market."
 
 Mike Biggs (Lead Consultant, Production Innovation, ThoughtWorks): 我们只有三周时间来完成任务，但是我们仍然决定花整整第一周的时间来了解买家行为。我们通过情景调查，面对面交流和一些电话访谈，开放地收集买家的想法。最后我们发现了买家的两个主要痛点：一是拍卖过程中的价格透明化，二是房产报告的获取。于是我们花了八天开发出了一款应用来给顾客传输显示房产报告并观察他们的反应。这一步很重要，因为它保证了我们能在接下来的两周里保持在正确的方向上不断推进。和BresicWhitney的紧密合作，让我们能了解行业标准，更快地学习，于是我们能在把任何产品创意带到市场上之前验证它们。
 
> "The new product is already demonstrated to us that the buyers are enjoying the process in buying much more. They're able to make faster decisions which is leading to quicker sales. This is offering great benefits to our sellers and we're also seeing great effeciencies in our role in the transation."

Shannan Whitney (CEO, BresicWhitney): 这个新产品已经向我们展示了买家更喜欢新的购买流程。他们更快地做出购买决定就缩短了我们的销售周期。这对我们的卖家来说是巨大的收益，同时也极大地提高了我们的工作效率。
 
 > "It's really easy to use the app to just download the strata reports contracts and floor plans so that I don't have to email the agents and take weeks to do that and I can make a decision on the spot whether or not I'm gonna proceed with the property and provide an offer."
 
 房产买家: 使用这个应用来下载维护报告和平面图实在是太方便了。这样我就不用给中介公司发邮件，然后花上几周时间来做决定要不要买这套房产了。
 
 > "I think the biggest thing that I noticed was the speed and efficiency, they can just download it straight away instead of waiting for us to get back to them on Monday. I had a transaction recently, the information was available there pretty much from the time when the offer was made, they could download that information instantly and it was closed within 24 hours." 
 
 Matthew Carvalho (地区销售, BresicWhitney): 我认为最重要的变化是迅速和高效，顾客能直接下载所需的资料，而不用等着我们过完周末之后回来再给他们。我最近就做了一笔交易，房源信息一发布，相关资料也马上可以查阅，顾客就直接下载了文件，然后24小时内，这笔交易就完成了。
 
 > "Oh yeah you want to be able to work in real time, I mean that's what today's all about, being able to make quick decisions in a hot market, with the information all at hand. Normally some of that is emailed to you a few days later when the agent contacts you and says you're interested so like the contract of sale but definitely not the strata report and not as readily available as that in real time. So yeah it's good. "
 
 房产买家: 当然啦，你得跟上节奏，我的意思是这就是现代的工作方式，用手中拥有的信息，在一个激烈的市场里快速地做出决定。一般来说，有些代理人会在几天之后给你发邮件，询问你对销售合同还感不感兴趣，但是绝对不会提供维护报告，就算有也不会像这样及时、方便。所以说，这应用很赞。

BresicWhitney is an Australian lifestyle property group founded in 2003. The company is now a multi-office brand connecting people and property within Sydney’s widespread inner-city basin.

BresicWhitney是澳洲的顶尖房产中介公司，成立于2003年。目前这家公司拥有多处办公室，负责将顾客和悉尼广袤的内城区域的房产联结起来。

Their ambition is to bring honour back into the real estate industry by building trust with buyers and, at the same time, adding value to property sellers.

他们的愿景是，与买家建立信任，同时为房产卖家增加价值，重塑房地产行业的辉煌。

Together with ThoughtWorks they chose to run a time boxed innovation lab, a process that allows validating ideas quickly with real customers rather than making a big upfront investment.
 
在贸然投入大笔投资之前，他们选择与ThoughtWorks一起进行限时的创新实验室活动，通过真实用户来快速验证想法。

Using real-time observations and interviews, the team quickly uncovered that property seekers needed better ‘price transparency of auctions’ and availability of ‘strata reports’ to simplify the buying decision process. A working prototype was delivered after only three days of development.

经过现场观察和访谈，合作团队很快发现如果想简化房产买家的决策流程，那么就需要更价格透明的拍卖和更靠谱的维护记录。在仅仅三天之后，一个可工作的原型就诞生了。

The HTML5 mobile web app allows property seekers to access their desired reports on any smartphone while inspecting a property, giving buyers as much information as possible to expedite the decision making process. In real time, the agent can see which reports were accessed, when and where. The app creates a prioritised list that helps agents focus on warm property seekers so they can better help them find the right home that meets their needs.

这是一个HTML5的手机网页应用，允许用户可以在现场看房时，通过手机获得任何他们想要的报告，为用户提供充足的信息来加速决策。同时，代理人能够看到哪些报告在何时何地被查看过。换而言之，这个应用创建了一个优先级的列表，协助代理人更好地找到满足顾客的需求的房产。

The new product is already demonstrating results. Property seekers are empowered to make quicker decisions which has a positive impact on BW’s sales cycle (down from several days to 24 hours). This allows BW to bring property seekers, sellers, and agents together in a way that creates a meaningful experience.  

这个新产品已经展示出了成果：房产买家能够更快地做出决策，不仅对BW的销售周期来说有着积极的意义（从几天降低到了24小时），还为房产买卖双方及代理人创造了很有意义的体验。

> “Running the Innovation Lab with ThoughtWorks was primarily driven by our desire to really improve the way we work. Our industry really hasn’t changed much in the past 20 years and is dominated by one big player — this type of innovation is key to our success.”
- Shannan Whitney, Chief Executive Officer 

> “和ThoughtWorks合作举办创新实验室，主要动力来自于我们对提升工作方式的迫切渴望。我们的行业在过去的20年里都没有太大的改变，并且一家独大。而这次的创新就是我们成功的关键。”
